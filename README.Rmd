* `promor` is a user-friendly, comprehensive R package that combines proteomics 
data analysis with machine learning-based modeling. 

* `promor` streamlines differential expression analysis of 
**label-free quantification (LFQ)** proteomics data and building predictive 
models with top protein candidates.

* With `promor` we provide a range of quality control and visualization tools to analyze label-free proteomics data at the 
protein level.

* Input files for `promor` are the [proteinGroups.txt ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caranathunge/promor_example_data/main/pg1.txt)
file produced by [**MaxQuant**](https://maxquant.org) and an [expDesign.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caranathunge/promor_example_data/main/ed1.txt) file, which contains the 
experimental design of your proteomics data.

### Proteomics data analysis with promor

![promor prot analysis flow chart by caranathunge](./man/figures/promor_ProtAnalysisFlowChart_small.png){width=100%}
*Figure 1. A schematic diagram of suggested workflows for proteomics data analysis with promor.*


#### Example

Here is a minimal working example showing how to identify differentially
expressed proteins between two conditions using `promor` in five simple steps. 
We use a previously published data set from [Cox et al. (2014)](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/24942700#id609082) (PRIDE ID: PXD000279).

```{r example, results = 'hide', warning=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# Load promor
library(promor)

# Create a raw_df object with the files provided in this github account.
raw <- create_df(
  prot_groups = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caranathunge/promor_example_data/main/pg1.txt",
  exp_design = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caranathunge/promor_example_data/main/ed1.txt"
)

# Filter out proteins with high levels of missing data in either condition or group
raw_filtered <- filterbygroup_na(raw)

# Impute missing data and create an imp_df object.
imp_df <- impute_na(raw_filtered)

# Normalize data and create a norm_df object
norm_df <- normalize_data(imp_df)

# Perform differential expression analysis and create a fit_df object
fit_df <- find_dep(norm_df)
```

Lets take a look at the results using a volcano plot.

```{r volcanoplot, warning = FALSE,  eval=FALSE}
volcano_plot(fit_df, text_size = 5)
```

### Modeling with promor

![promor flowchart-modeling by caranathunge](./man/figures/promor_ProtModelingFlowChart_small.png){width=100%}
*Figure 2. A schematic diagram of suggested workflows for building predictive models with promor.*

#### Example

The following minimal working example shows you how to use your results from  differential expression analysis to build machine learning-based predictive models using `promor`. 

We use a previously published data set from [Suvarna et al. (2021)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2021.652799/full#h3) that used differentially expressed proteins between severe and non-severe COVID patients to build models to predict COVID severity.

```{r modeling_example, results = 'hide', warning = FALSE, message = F, eval = FALSE}
# First, let's make a model_df object of top differentially expressed proteins.
# We will be using example fit_df and norm_df objects provided with the package.
covid_model_df <- pre_process(
  fit_df = covid_fit_df,
  norm_df = covid_norm_df
)

# Next, we split the data into training and test data sets
covid_split_df <- split_data(model_df = covid_model_df)

# Let's train our models using the default list of machine learning algorithms
covid_model_list <- train_models(split_df = covid_split_df)

# We can now use our models to predict the test data
covid_prob_list <- test_models(
  model_list = covid_model_list,
  split_df = covid_split_df
)
```


Let's make ROC plots to check how the different models performed.

```{r rocplot, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE,  message = F}

roc_plot(
  probability_list = covid_prob_list,
  split_df = covid_split_df
)
```
