## Introduction
This tutorial shows you how you can use *promor* to build predictive models using top differentially expressed proteins.

We recommend that you first go through the simple working example provided in **Introduction to promor** to get acquainted with *promor*'s functionality.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
vignette("intro_to_promor")
```

A tutorial for **proteomics data without technical replicates** is provided here:
[Promor: No technical replicates](https://caranathunge.github.io/promor/articles/promor_no_techreps.html)

A tutorial for **proteomics data with technical replicates** is provided here:
[Promor: Technical replicates](https://caranathunge.github.io/promor/articles/promor_with_techreps.html)

## Data
For this tutorial we will be using a previously published data set from [Suvarna et al. (2021)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2021.652799/full#h3). In this study, authors used differentially expressed proteins between **33 severe** and **18 non-severe** COVID patients to build models to predict COVID severity. Here, we are using a subset of that data set (18 severe and 18 non-severe COVID patients).

## Workflow

*Figure 1. A schematic diagram showing the suggested promor workflow for building predictive models with protein candidates*

**You can access the help pages for functions shown above and more using** `?function_name`

## Input data
To build predictive models with *promor*, you need:

-  A **fit_df** object produced by running `find_dep` for differential expression analysis. For this example, we will be using `covid_fit_df` object provided with the package.

-  An **norm_df** object which is a data frame of normalized protein intensities used as input for `find_dep`. We will be using `covid_norm_df` object provided with the package.


## 1. Create a *model_df* object
Let's first create a *model_df* object with the example `fit_df` and `norm_df` objects provided with the package. 


> **Notes**
>
>* `pre_process` function uses information from the two objects to create a data frame of protein intensities in a suitable format for modeling.\
>* If you run this step with default options, highly correlated proteins (features) will be identified and removed from the data frame.\
>* Alternatively, you can set `find_highcorr = FALSE` and `rem_highcorr = FALSE`, but it is **not recommended**. You can also tweak the `corr_cutoff` to change the threshold for identifying highly correlated proteins.\
>* Note: if no or few differentially expressed proteins were identified at the given adjusted p-value cutoff, you can choose to relax these criteria to use more proteins in modeling.\
>* See `?pre_process` for more information.

```{r preprocess, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load promor
library(promor)

#Create a model_df object with the top differentially expressed proteins.
covid_model_df <- pre_process(fit_df = covid_fit_df,
                        norm_df = covid_norm_df)

#Let's take a look at the first few rows of the model_df object
head(covid_model_df)
```


## 2. Visualize protein (feature) variation among conditions (classes)
At this stage, we can visualize the feature variation among classes using box plots or density plots. 

>**Notes**
>
>* Your best proteins (features) for modeling are those that show distinct patterns of variation among conditions.\
>* For example, these proteins may show mostly non-overlapping density distributions.

### Feature plots - box plots
```{r featureplot, dpi = 300, out.width = '90%', fig.asp=2,  fig.align ='center', warning = FALSE, message = F}
#Box plots (default) to visualize feature variation
feature_plot(model_df = covid_model_df, 
             n_row = 4, 
             n_col = 2)
```

### Feature plots - density plots

```{r featureplot_d, dpi = 300, out.width = '90%', fig.asp=2,  fig.align ='center', warning = FALSE, message = F}
#Alternatively, make density plots
feature_plot(model_df = covid_model_df, 
             type = "density",
             n_row = 4,
             n_col = 2)
```

* At this stage, if you decide to remove a protein or some proteins from the `model_df` object, you can do so with `rem_feature`.


## 3. Split *model_df* object into training and test data sets
Next, we will split the `model_df` object into training and test data sets **while maintaining class or condition proportions in each set**.

>**Notes**
>
>* By default, 80% of the data will be added to the training set while 20% will be added to the test set.
>* You can change these proportions by setting `train_size` to a higher or a lower value.

```{r splitdata, warning = FALSE, message = F}
#Create a split_df object by splitting data into training and test data set
covid_split_df <- split_data(model_df = covid_model_df)
```
Access items in the `split_df` object.
```{r accesssplits, eval=FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#You can access the items in the training data set as follows,
covid_split_df$training
#Similarly, access the test data set
covid_split_df$test
```


## 4. Train machine learning models on the training data set
We will be using some functions from the `caret` package to train models on our training data set. 

>**Notes**
>
>* A list of all the available machine learning algorithms can be found here: http://topepo.github.io/caret/train-models-by-tag.html.
>* Note that some algorithms may require additional arguments. See `caret` functions `train` and `trControl` for more details.
>* The default list of classification-based algorithms  provided include:
>     + `"svmRadial"` - A support vector machine algorithm
>     + `"glm"`- A generalized linear model algorithm
>     + `"rf"` - A random forest algorithm
>     + `"xgbLinear"` - An extreme gradient boosting algorithm


```{r traindata, warning = FALSE, message = F, eval = TRUE}
#Create a model_list object by training models on the training data set using the default list of algorithms.
covid_model_list <- train_models(split_df = covid_split_df)
```

```{r customalgo, warning = FALSE, message = F, eval=FALSE}
#Alternatively, you may use a custom list of algorithms.
covid_model_list <- train_models(split_df = covid_split_df, 
                                   algorithm_list = c("glm", "rf"))
```


## 5. Check model performance
We can now check how models built with each algorithm performed on the resamples of the training data set.

### Performance plots - box plots
```{r performplot, dpi = 300, out.width = '80%', fig.asp=1,  fig.align ='center', warning = FALSE, message = F}
#Box plots (default) to visualize model performance
performance_plot(model_list = covid_model_list)
```

### Performance plots - dot plots
```{r performplotd, dpi = 300, out.width = '80%', fig.asp=1,  fig.align ='center', warning = FALSE, message = F}
#Make dot plots
performance_plot(model_list = covid_model_list,
                 type = "dot")
```

*It looks like, except for `"glm"` method, all others performed fairly well.

## 6. Check variable importance
We can check which proteins out of the 10 are most important in the models.

### Variable importance plots - lollipop plots
```{r varimpl, dpi = 300, out.width = '80%', fig.asp=1,  fig.align ='center', warning = FALSE, message = F}
#Make lollipop plots (default)
varimp_plot(model_list = covid_model_list, 
            text_size = 7,
            n_row = 2,
            n_col = 2)
```

### Variable importance plots - bar plots
```{r varimpb, dpi = 300, out.width = '80%', fig.asp=1,  fig.align ='center', warning = FALSE, message = F}
#Make bar plots
varimp_plot(model_list = covid_model_list, 
            type = "bar",
            text_size = 7,
            n_row = 2,
            n_col = 2)
```

* At this stage you can again use `rem_feature` function to **remove proteins with lower importance** in the models and **repeat steps from Step 3**.

## 7. Test models on the test data set
We are now ready to test our models on never-before-seen data or our test data set.

```{r testdata, warning = FALSE, message = F}
#First we run the function with type = "prob" to get a probability list
covid_prob_list <- test_models(model_list = covid_model_list, 
                               split_df = covid_split_df,
                               type = "prob" )
```

Alternatively, you can output a list of predictions and output a confusion matrix for further analysis.
```{r testdatar, warning = FALSE, message = F, eval = FALSE}
#We run the function with type = "raw" to get a prediction list and output a confusion matrix
covid_pred_list <- test_models(model_list = covid_model_list, 
                               split_df = covid_split_df,
                               type = "raw",
                               save_confusionmatrix = TRUE)
```

## 8. Build Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves
Finally, we can build ROC plots to assess the predictive power of our models.

>**Notes**
>
>* `roc_plot` function requires a `probability_list` object. 
>* Make sure to set `type = "prob"` when running `test_models` to output a `probability_list` object.

```{r rocplot, dpi = 300, out.width = '80%', fig.asp=1,  fig.align ='center', warning = FALSE, message = F}
#Make bar plots
roc_plot(probability_list = covid_prob_list, 
         split_df = covid_split_df)
```
