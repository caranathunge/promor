## Introduction
* `promor` is a user-friendly, comprehensive R package that combines proteomics 
data analysis with machine learning-based modeling. 
* `promor` streamlines differential expression analysis of 
**label-free quantification (LFQ)** proteomics data and building predictive 
models with top protein candidates.
* Input files for `promor` are the [**proteinGroups.txt**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caranathunge/promor_example_data/main/pg1.txt)
file produced by **MaxQuant** and an [**expDesign.txt**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caranathunge/promor_example_data/main/ed1.txt) file, which contains the 
experimental design of your proteomics data.
* `promor` provides a wealth of data analysis and visualization tools at the 
protein level to analyze label-free proteomics data.


## Installation

You can install the development version of promor from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install devtools, if you haven't already:
install.packages("devtools")

# install promor from github
devtools::install_github("caranathunge/promor")
```

## Proteomics data analysis with promor
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}

```

### Example

Here is a minimal working example showing how to identify differentially
expressed proteins between two conditions using `promor` in five simple steps.
We use a previously published data set from [Cox et al. (2014)](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/24942700#id609082) (PRIDE ID: PXD000279).

```{r example, results = 'hide', warning=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
#Load promor
library(promor)
#Create a raw_df object with the files provided in this github account.
raw <- create_df(
prot_groups = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caranathunge/promor_example_data/main/pg1.txt",
exp_design = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caranathunge/promor_example_data/main/ed1.txt"
  )
#Filter out proteins with high levels of missing data in each condition
raw_filtered <- filterbygroup_na(raw)
#Impute missing data and create an imp_df object.
imp_df <- impute_na(raw_filtered)
#Normalize data and create a norm_df object
norm_df <- normalize_data(imp_df)
#Perform differential expression analysis and create a fit_df object
fit_df <- find_dep(norm_df)
```
Lets take a look at the results using a volcano plot.
```{r volcanoplot, warning = FALSE,  dpi = 300, out.width = '70%', fig.align ='center', eval = FALSE}
 volcano_plot(fit_df, text_size = 5)
```

## Modeling with promor
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/promor_ProtModelingFlowChart_small.png")
```

### Example

The following minimal working example shows you how to use your results from  differential expression analysis to build machine learning-based predictive models using *promor*. 

We use a previously published data set from [Suvarna et al. (2021)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2021.652799/full#h3) that used differentially expressed proteins between severe and non-severe COVID patients to build models to predict COVID severity.

```{r modeling_example, results = 'hide', warning = FALSE,message = F, eval = FALSE}
#First, let's make a model_df object of top differentially expressed proteins. 
#We will be using example fit_df and norm_df objects provided with the package.
covid_model_df <- pre_process(fit_df = covid_fit_df, 
                              norm_df = covid_norm_df)
#Next, we split the data into training and test data sets
covid_split_df <- split_data(model_df = covid_model_df)

#Let's train our models using the default list of machine learning algorithms
covid_model_list <- train_models(split_df = covid_split_df)

#We can now use our models to predict the test data
covid_prob_list <- test_models(model_list = covid_model_list, 
                               split_df = covid_split_df)
```


Let's make ROC plots to check how the different models performed.

```{r rocplot, warning = FALSE, dpi = 300, out.width = '90%', fig.align ='center', message = F, eval = FALSE}

roc_plot(probability_list = covid_prob_list,
         split_df = covid_split_df)

```
